    "## 6. Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the above analysis, we can observe that the model is able to correct different kind of errors and at the same time failed to correct same kind of errors. \n",
    "- Almost all spelling mistakes are corrected properly and most of the verb forms are corrected properly. \n",
    "- Some errors are not trained properly as these errors are few. \n",
    "- With much more data and by applying these errors to large data, we can train and predict much more efficiently.\n",
    "- Transformer modelling is a great approach to this problem. Using quantization, we can reduce the model parameters and can try to build the model efficiently."
